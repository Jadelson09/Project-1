                <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic website content, i.e. anything
                    that moves, refreshes, or otherwise changes on your screen without requiring you to manually reload
                    a web page. Features like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Animated graphics</li>
                    <li>Photo slideshows</li>
                    <li>Autocomplete text suggestions</li>
                    <li>Interactive forms</li>
                </ul>
                <p>An even better way of understanding what JavaScript does is to think about certain web features you
                    use every day and likely take for granted—like when your Facebook timeline automatically updates on
                    your screen or Google suggests search terms based on a few letters you’ve started typing. In both
                    cases, that’s JavaScript in action.</p>
                <p>The results of JavaScript may seem simple, but there’s a reason why we teach an entire segment on

                <p>When most people learn to code, they start with good old HTML and CSS. From there, they move on to
                    JavaScript. Which makes sense! The three elements together form the backbone of web development.</p>
                <p>For those not familiar:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>HTML</strong> is the structure of your page—the headers, the body text, any images you
                        want to include <code>&lthtml&gt HTML goes here &lt/html&gt</code></li>
                    <li><strong>CSS</strong> controls how that page looks (it’s what you’ll use to customize fonts,
                        background colors, etc.)<code>&ltstyle&gt CSS goes here &lt/style&gt</code></li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is the magic third element. Once you’ve created your structure
                        (HTML) and your aesthetic vibe (CSS), JavaScript makes your site or project
                        dynamic.<code>&ltscript&gt script goes here &lt/script&gt</code></li>

            <article>
                <p>I mentioned above that JavaScript is a “scripting language.” Scripting languages are coding languages
                    used to automate processes that users would otherwise need to execute on their own, step-by-step.
                    Short of scripting, any changes on web pages you visit would require either manually reloading the
                    page, or navigating a series of static menus to get to the content you’re after</p>
                <p>A scripting language like JavaScript (JS, for those in the know) does the heavy lifting by telling
                    computer programs like websites or web applications to “do something.” In the case of JavaScript,
                    this means telling those dynamic features described earlier to do whatever it is they do—like
                    telling images to animate themselves, photos to cycle through a slideshow, or autocomplete
                    suggestions to respond to prompts. It’s the “script” in JavaScript that makes these things happen
                    seemingly on their own.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, because JavaScript is such an integral part of web functionality, all major web browsers
                    come with built-in engines that can render JavaScript. This means JS commands can be typed directly
                    into an HTML document, and web browsers will be able to understand them. In other words, using
                    JavaScript doesn’t require downloading any additional programs or compilers.</p>

                <p>JavaScript is either embedded into a web page or else it’s included in a .js file. JavaScript is also
                    a “client-side” language (rather than a “server-side” language), which is a fancy way of saying that
                    it gets downloaded to site visitors’ computers, then processed.</p>
                <h3 id="How_do_you_add_JavaScript_to_a_website?">How do you add JavaScript to a website?</h3>
                <p>Actually adding JavaScript code to a web page is a pretty simple process (and a familiar one if
                    you’ve done any coding with HTML and CSS). JavaScript can be added directly to a page’s code using
                    the opening and closing tag for script</p>
                <p>Honestly, JavaScript looks very similar to adding CSS to a site. Here’s a side-by-side comparison:
                </p>
                <p><strong>CSS</strong>:<code>
                        &ltstyle&gt CSS goes here &lt/style&gt
                    </code></p>
                <p><strong>JavaScript</strong><code>
                        &ltscript type="text/javascript"&gt
                        JavaScript code goes Here
                        &ltscript&gt
                    </code></p>
                <p>Voila! JavaScript code can also be added to a page as a separate header file with the extension .js
                    (generally done if it’s code that you want to include across a number of pages at once). The script
                    is then downloaded and processed in each individual’s web browser, turning it into the dynamic
                    objects and effects they see on their screen.</p>
                <p>One word of warning, though: since JavaScript is processed by individual browsers, it’s possible a
                    user might have JavaScript disabled on their end. Sites that use JavaScript need to have a back up
                    plan in place to avoid breaking when this happens.</p>

            <article>
                <p>As you dig into JavaScript you’ll eventually hear the term “vanilla Javascript.” So what does that
                    mean?</p>
                <p>Vanilla JavaScript is the JavaScript language “as is” without using any tools to make the coding
                    process easier or more efficient.</p>
                <p>To give you an idea of what vanilla JavaScript looks like, consider the following basic example of
                    JavaScript code. If you wanted users to receive a “thanks for signing up” confirmation message after
                    signing up for an offer or service on a website, you would code it directly into an HTML page
                    (between &ltscript&gt tags) like this:</p>
                <p><code>&ltscript&gt
                        window.onload = initAll;
                        function initAll() {
                        document.getElementById(“submit”).onclick = submitMessage;
                        }
                        function submitMessage() {
                        var greeting = document.getElementById(“name”).getAttribute(“value”);
                        document.getElementById(“headline”).innerHTML = “Thank you for joining our email list,” +
                        greeting;
                        return false;
                        }
                        &lt/script&gt</code></p>
                <p>Vanilla JS like this can be used to create JavaScript projects, but as you become more familiar with
                    the JavaScript language, there are different tools you can implement to make JS easier and more
                    efficient to use.</p>

                <p><strong>JavaScript</strong> - JavaScript is a lightweight programming language(“scripting language”)
                    and used to make web pages interactive. It can insert dynamic text into HTML. JavaScript is also
                    known as browser’s language. JavaScript(JS) is not similar or related to Java. Both the languages
                    have a C like a syntax and are widely used in client-side and server-side Web applications, but
                    there are few similarities only.</p>

                <p>As you might imagine, using vanilla javascript alone takes…forever and for web developers, and time
                    is money. That’s why JavaScript frameworks and libraries (tools that make JS a whooole lot easier to
                    use) are your new best friends. Here’s a breakdown of some of the main ones you’ll encounter and
                    what they do.</p>
                <h3 id="JQUERY_the_o.g._JavaScript_library">JQUERY—THE O.G. JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY</h3>
                <p>When you work with JavaScript, you’ll notice JS functions and features that show up regularly across
                    multiple websites or web apps—things like menu animations and fade outs, file upload forms, and
                    image galleries. While you could code each of these things from the ground up every time you need
                    one, your coding life will feel a lot easier if you use coding libraries like jQuery instead</p>
                <p>The jQuery library is made up of JavaScript coding functions that can be performed through single
                    line jQuery commands. For example, the JavaScript code example above looks like this if it’s
                    performed using jQuery code instead:</p>
                <p><code>&ltscript&gt
                        $(“#submit”).click(function () {
                        var greeting = $(“#name”).val();
                        $(“#headline”).html(“Thank you for joining our email list, ” + greeting);
                        return false;
                        });
                        &lt/script&gt</code></p>
                <p>As you can see, the jQuery programming approach is a lot more concise, and it can be reused any time
                    you want to perform the same JavaScript function while coding a website or web app.</p>
                <p>In addition to examples like the one above (which are considered jQuery snippets—snippets of code
                    inserted directly from the jQuery library to perform dedicated functions), jQuery code can be put
                    together to create more complicated plugins. jQuery plugins can be found directly from the jQuery UI
                    (User Interface) repository, where source code is available for copying and pasting.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Along with jQuery, React JS is another key JavaScript library for web developers. React JS is a front
                    end JavaScript library developed by Facebook in 2011 and designed specifically for building UIs
                    (user interfaces). If you’re not familiar, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars,
                    buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to use a website or app, and while you CAN build
                    them painstakingly by hand with vanilla JavaScript, who has time for that?</p>
                <p>React allows developers to use prewritten code for repetitive menu objects and effects (like
                    interactive forms, autocomplete features, fade-in or out menu animations, etc.), and it also
                    improves overall site speed and performance through feature called Virtual DOM (which you can read
                    all about here). Learning how to use React JS will make your life a whole lot easier as a JavaScript
                    developer, and it will also make you a lot more hireable.</p>

            <article>
                <p>While JS libraries like jQuery and React function as digital Swiss Army knives for individual coding
                    needs, front-end developers can take things a step farther by using tools called JavaScript
                    frameworks.</p>
                <p>Extending past the patchwork functionality of jQuery, JS frameworks provide JavaScript developers
                    with full templates for websites or web applications. JS frameworks then create spaces in those
                    templates where JS code is recommended to go, as well as prewritten code (much like jQuery) that can
                    be plugged into those spaces.</p>
                <p>While there are a number of frameworks that can are considered industry standards (e.g. Vue, and
                    Angular), your best bet when picking one to learn is to consider potential employers or clients and
                    identify which JS framework—if any—they favor. And keep in mind, once you’ve learned one framework,
                    it’s relatively easy to pick up more.</p>
