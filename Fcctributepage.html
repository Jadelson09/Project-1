            <h2>About Martin Luther King Jr</h2>
            <p>Martin Luther King, Jr., (January 15, 1929-April 4, 1968) was born Michael Luther King, Jr., but later
                had
                his name changed to Martin. His grandfather began the family’s long tenure as pastors of the Ebenezer
                Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to 1931; his father has served from then until the present,
                and
                from 1960 until his death Martin Luther acted as co-pastor. Martin Luther attended segregated public
                schools
                in Georgia, graduating from high school at the age of fifteen; he received the B. A. degree in 1948 from
                Morehouse College, a distinguished Negro institution of Atlanta from which both his father and
                grandfather
                had graduated.</p>
            <p>After three years of theological study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania where he was
                elected
                president of a predominantly white senior class, he was awarded the B.D. in 1951. With a fellowship won
                at
                Crozer, he enrolled in graduate studies at Boston University, completing his residence for the doctorate
                in
                1953 and receiving the degree in 1955. In Boston he met and married Coretta Scott, a young woman of
                uncommon
                intellectual and artistic attainments. Two sons and two daughters were born into the family.</p>
            <p>In 1954, Martin Luther King became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama.
                Always
                a strong worker for civil rights for members of his race, King was, by this time, a member of the
                executive
                committee of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the leading organization of
                its
                kind in the nation. He was ready, then, early in December, 1955, to accept the leadership of the first
                great
                Negro nonviolent demonstration of contemporary times in the United States, the bus boycott described by
                Gunnar Jahn in his presentation speech in honor of the laureate. </p>
            <p>The boycott lasted 382 days. On December 21, 1956, after the Supreme Court of the United States had
                declared
                unconstitutional the laws requiring segregation on buses, Negroes and whites rode the buses as equals.
                During these days of boycott, King was arrested, his home was bombed, he was subjected to personal
                abuse,
                but at the same time he emerged as a Negro leader of the first rank.</p>
            <p>In 1957 he was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization formed
                to
                provide new leadership for the now burgeoning civil rights movement. The ideals for this organization he
                took from Christianity; its operational techniques from Gandhi. In the eleven-year period between 1957
                and
                1968, King traveled over six million miles and spoke over twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever
                there was injustice, protest, and action; and meanwhile he wrote five books as well as numerous
                articles.
            </p>
            <p>In these years, he led a massive protest in Birmingham, Alabama, that caught the attention of the entire
                world, providing what he called a coalition of conscience. and inspiring his “Letter from a Birmingham
                Jail”, a manifesto of the Negro revolution; he planned the drives in Alabama for the registration of
                Negroes
                as voters; he directed the peaceful march on Washington, D.C., of 250,000 people to whom he delivered
                his
                address, “l Have a Dream”, he conferred with President John F. Kennedy and campaigned for President
                Lyndon
                B. Johnson; he was arrested upwards of twenty times and assaulted at least four times; he was awarded
                five
                honorary degrees; was named Man of the Year by Time magazine in 1963; and became not only the symbolic
                leader of American blacks but also a world figure.</p>
            <p>At the age of thirty-five, Martin Luther King, Jr., was the youngest man to have received the Nobel Peace
                Prize. When notified of his selection, he announced that he would turn over the prize money of $54,123
                to
                the furtherance of the civil rights movement.</p>
            <p>On the evening of April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of his motel room in Memphis, Tennessee,
                where
                he was to lead a protest march in sympathy with striking garbage workers of that city, he was
                assassinated
